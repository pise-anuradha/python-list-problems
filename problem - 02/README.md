# Problem - 02

Write a Python program to multiply all the items in a list.

## Problem Statement

The task is to create a Python program that calculates the product of all the items in a given list. Two solutions are provided: Solution 1 involves multiplying the elements of a pre-defined list, while Solution 2 allows the user to input the elements of the list.

### Solution - 1

### Approach:
Iterate through each element of the list and accumulate the product.

### Steps:
1. Initialize a variable `product` to store the product of elements.
2. Iterate through each element `i` in the list.
3. Multiply each element `i` with the `product`.
4. Print the product of all elements.

### Solution Explanation:
This solution directly operates on a predefined list, iterates through each element, and accumulates the product. Similar to Solution 1 for summing elements, it's a straightforward approach suitable for scenarios where the list is known in advance.

### Solution - 2

### Approach:
Allow the user to input the number of elements and the elements themselves, then calculate the product.

### Steps:
1. Prompt the user to input the number of elements.
2. Use a loop to input each element and add it to the list.
3. Calculate the product of all elements by iterating through the list.
4. Print the product of all elements.

### Solution Explanation:
In this solution, the program interacts with the user to input the elements of the list dynamically. It's useful when the list elements are not known beforehand and need to be provided by the user.
