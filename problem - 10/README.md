# Problem - 10

Write a Python program to find the list of words that are longer than n from a given list of words.

# Problem Statement

 Given a list of words, the program should identify and return a sublist containing words that are longer than a specified length.

## Solution

### Approach:
The program defines a function `wordCount(listName)` that takes a list of words as input and returns a sublist containing words longer than the specified length.

### Steps:
1. Define the function `wordCount(listName)`.
2. Prompt the user to enter the desired word length.
3. Iterate through each word in the input list.
4. If the length of the word is greater than the specified length, add it to the result sublist.
5. Return the sublist containing words longer than the specified length.

### Solution Explanation:
The `wordCount(listName)` function provides a user-friendly method to filter a list of words based on their length. By prompting the user for input, it allows flexibility in selecting the desired word length criteria and efficiently identifies and returns the sublist of words meeting the specified criteria.
