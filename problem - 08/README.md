# Problem - 08

Write a Python program to check a list is empty or not.

# Problem Statement

Given a Python program to check whether a given list is empty or not, we need to document its implementation and provide explanations for its solution.

## Solution 

### Approach:
The approach involves defining a function `isEmpty(list_name)` that takes a list as input and checks whether it's empty or not using the `len()` function.

### Steps:
- Define the function `isEmpty(list_name)`.
- Check the length of the input list using `len(list_name)`.
- If the length is 0, print 'The list is empty'.
- Otherwise, print 'The list is not empty'.

### Solution Explanation:
The function `isEmpty(list_name)` provides a simple and efficient way to determine whether a given list is empty or not. It's a straightforward implementation that relies on the length of the list to make the determination.
