# Problem - 01

Write a Python program to sum all the items in a list.

# Problem Statement

The task is to create a Python program to sum all the items in a given list. Two solutions are provided: Solution 1 involves summing the elements of a pre-defined list, while Solution 2 allows the user to input the elements of the list.

## Solution - 1

### Approach:
Iterate through each element of the list and accumulate the sum.

### Steps:
1. Initialize a variable `total` to store the sum of elements.
2. Iterate through each element `i` in the list.
3. Add each element `i` to the `total`.
4. Print the sum of all elements.

### Solution Explanation:
This solution directly operates on a predefined list, iterates through each element, and accumulates the sum. It's a straightforward approach suitable for scenarios where the list is known in advance.

## Solution - 2

### Approach:
Allow the user to input the number of elements and the elements themselves, then calculate the sum.

### Steps:
1. Prompt the user to input the number of elements.
2. Use a loop to input each element and add it to the list.
3. Calculate the sum of all elements using the `sum()` function.
4. Print the sum of all elements.

### Solution Explanation:
In this solution, the program interacts with the user to input the elements of the list dynamically. It's useful when the list elements are not known beforehand and need to be provided by the user.
