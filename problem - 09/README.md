# Problem - 09

Write a Python program to clone or copy a list.

# Problem Statement

The task is to create a Python program that can clone or copy a given list.

## Solution

### Approach:
The program defines a function `makeCopy(listName)` that takes a list as input and generates a copy of that list using the `copy()` method.

### Steps:
1. Define the function `makeCopy(listName)`.
2. Utilize the `copy()` method to produce a new list that replicates the input list.
3. Display the newly copied list.

### Solution Explanation:
The `makeCopy(listName)` function provides a straightforward approach to duplicating a given list. By utilizing the `copy()` method, it ensures that changes made to the original list do not impact the copied list.
