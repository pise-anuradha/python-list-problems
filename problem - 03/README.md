# Problem - 03

Write a Python program to get the largest number from a list.

## Problem Statement

The task is to create a Python program that finds the largest number from a given list. Two solutions are provided: Solution 1 directly utilizes the `max()` function to find the maximum number in a pre-defined list, while Solution 2 allows the user to input the elements of the list dynamically and then finds the largest number.

### Solution - 1

#### Approach:
Use the `max()` function to find the largest number in the list.

#### Steps:
1. Define a list containing the elements.
2. Use the `max()` function to find the largest number in the list.
3. Print the largest number.

### Solution Explanation:
This solution is straightforward and efficient. It directly applies the `max()` function to the list to obtain the largest number.

### Solution - 2

#### Approach:
Allow the user to input the number of elements and the elements themselves, then find the largest number.

#### Steps:
1. Prompt the user to input the number of elements.
2. Use a loop to input each element and add it to the list.
3. Use the `max()` function to find the largest number in the list.
4. Print the largest number.

### Solution Explanation:
In this solution, the program interacts with the user to input the elements of the list dynamically. It then finds the largest number using the `max()` function. This approach is useful when the list elements are not known beforehand and need to be provided by the user.
